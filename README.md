# üé® Bootstrap Basics: Utilities, Forms, and Components

This project is a hands-on assignment designed to demonstrate mastery of core Bootstrap 5 concepts, utilities, and components by creating a fully functional, responsive single-page layout.

## Project Overview
The objective of this assignment was to apply various Bootstrap elements including forms, tables, utility classes, and a responsive navbar to build a webpage that maintains optimal structure and usability across all device sizes. This ensures a deep understanding of the framework's mobile-first approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Highlights
This project successfully integrates multiple facets of the Bootstrap framework:

1. Form Creation and Layout (Part 1)
- Grid Layout: Implemented the Bootstrap Grid System to place the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side using <kbd>row</kbd> and <kbd>col</kbd> classes, showcasing efficient horizontal layout management.

- Form Components: Utilized standard Bootstrap form components for fields like Email and Password.

- Validation: Applied validation classes (e.g., <kbd>is-invalid</kbd>) and the <kbd>required</kbd> attribute to the Email and Password fields, simulating basic client-side form validation.

- Styling: The submission button is styled clearly using the built-in <kbd>btn-success</kbd> utility class.

2. Table for Displaying Data (Part 2)
- Data Display: Created a professional-looking <kbd>table</kbd> using Bootstrap's table component.

- Readability: Enhanced user experience by applying <kbd>table-striped</kbd> and <kbd>table-hover</kbd> classes.

- Responsiveness: Ensured the table content does not overflow on small devices by wrapping it in the <kbd>table-responsive</kbd> container.

3. Image and Button Utilities (Part 3)
- Image Responsiveness: Implemented the <kbd>img-fluid</kbd> class to ensure the primary image scales proportionally to the size of its parent container.

- Image Styling: Demonstrated utility usage by creating a second image with the <kbd>rounded-circle</kbd> class.

- Responsive Display Utilities:

- One button remains visible on all screen sizes.

- The second button uses <kbd>d-none</kbd> (hide on all) and <kbd>d-md-block</kbd> (show on medium screens and up) to conditionally display content based on the viewport size.

4. Responsive Navigation Bar (Part 4)
- Component Usage: Built a complete, mobile-friendly navigation bar using the <kbd>navbar</kbd> and <kbd>navbar-expand-md</kbd> components.

- Collapse Feature: Ensured the navigation links collapse into the standard hamburger menu on smaller screens, maximizing vertical space.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a JavaScript component (e.g., a simple modal) that confirms form submission.

- Replace hard-coded table data with dynamic data fetched from a local <b>JSON file</b> or a mock API.

- Add custom Sass styling to override Bootstrap's primary colors for unique branding.
